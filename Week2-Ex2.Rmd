## Exercício 2 da Week 2

```{r Week2-Ex2}
# Criando vetor com as temperaturas mensais médias de Baltimore
baltimore <- c(3.47,	3.02, 3.93,	3.00,	3.89,	3.43,	3.85,	3.74,	3.98,	3.16,	3.12,	3.35)
names(baltimore) <- c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")

baltimoreInMM <- baltimore * 25.4
baltimoreInMM
infoBaltimore <- summary(baltimoreInMM)
infoBaltimore <- infoBaltimore[c(1,4,6)]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
